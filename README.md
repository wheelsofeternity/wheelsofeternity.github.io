# Wheels of Eternity

The wheels of eternity is a universal idea of unity and equality. Wheels within wheels within wheels are these circles we share. 
This idea is further described in the free downloadable PDF of the book _Oneiszero: A Universal Theory of Everything and Nothing_ which is offered to download [here](/oneiszero.pdf).

Donations are accepted and proceeds will go toward the development of my creative aspirations.

If you would like a physical copy of this book, the first edition is available [here](https://www.createspace.com/4191196).
